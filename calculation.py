#Write a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. Define the two numbers as variables within the code and print the results for each operation.
a=int(input("Enter the value for a :"))
b=int(input("Enter the value for b :"))
print(f'Addition of {a} and {b} is',a+b)
#substract
print(f'Substraction of {a} and {b} is :',a-b)
#multiply
print(f'Multiplication of {a} and {b} is :',a*b)
#Division
print(f'Divison of {a} and {b} is :',a/b)
